Transcript

Host (Lynn): Hello everyone, and welcome to the Sustainable Ed podcast! I am your host Lynn Decker and today we're interviewing Prof. Jocelyn Whitman. She teaches Machine Learning in Wisconsin. Good morning Jocelyn, thanks for joining us on the podcast!
Guest(Julie): Thank you for having me!
Host: Soo.. this week, as always, we're talking about sustainability with a fellow professor. Now, Jocelyn- you've integrated sustainability in a meaningful way. Could you walk us through your process?
Guest: Well, you know, Machine Learning has been gaining momentum for quite a while and I realized it was important to also teach my students about its environmental impacts and trying to use ML algorithms in a sustainable way. My first step was to add sustainability-related information into the students' weekly labs. However, in the past two years I've also invited a specialist guest lecturer on sustainability. This has received great feedback and I'm proud of helping my students become better engineers for the future.
Host: What an interesting approach! How did you come up with the guest lecturer idea?
Guest: Well, my university has been encouraging us to invite guest lecturers for quite some time, and my dear friend Kim offered to help out. She is currently studying the sustainability of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Systems, and was excited to help outâ€“</span><span class="v6_1128">Contact links of the guest:
